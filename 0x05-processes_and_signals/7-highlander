# This script displays "To infinity and beyond" indefinitely and handles SIGTERM without terminating.

# Set the trap for SIGTERM (signal 15).
# When SIGTERM is received, it will:
# 1. Print "I am invincible!!!" using printf for reliable output.
# 2. Immediately set the trap for SIGTERM to an empty string (''), which tells the shell to ignore subsequent SIGTERMs.
# This ensures the script truly becomes "invincible" to SIGTERM and continues its loop.
trap 'printf "I am invincible!!!\n"; trap "" SIGTERM' SIGTERM

# Infinite loop to continuously display the phrase
